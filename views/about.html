          Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and
          was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art
          dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was
          transferred to London.<br /><br />He turned to religion and spent time
          as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill
          health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved
          back home with his parents.<br /><br />His younger brother Theo
          supported him financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by
          letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant
          labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished
          his later work.<br /><br />In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met
          members of the avant-garde, including Ã‰mile Bernard and Paul Gauguin,
          who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work
          developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local
          landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a
          style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south
          of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter
          to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.
